<DESCRIPTION>Brewer was closed due to the poor conditions of the buildings. After years of complaints that residents and visitors had to weave past buckets placed in hallways to catch rain water, an engineering firm inspected the facility and found that 14 of the 15 buildings on the campus presented a "hazard to human life". It was later estimated that the cost to renovate or remodel the buildings would be between $6 to $8 million -- money that the financially-strapped department did not have.</DESCRIPTION>

<DESCRIPTION>Sloss is an industrial site that was used to extract iron from iron ore. It is about 2 blocks large and was converted to a public park/museum. There's a little something for everyone, from the disused industrial buildings, to large metal tanks and structures, to old rail cars and even a tunnel. The blast furnaces and other structures are at least 8 stories tall. Also, if you are willing to risk life and limb, you can jump the gates and see the non-public parts of the site. You'll need lockpicks and a cutting torch (for the welded doors) to see some other parts.  </DESCRIPTION>

<COORDINATES>Coordinates: 38.304922,-81.561855</COORDINATES>
<DESCRIPTION>According to Way's Steam Towboat Directory, this legendary broken-down boat began its life as a steam-powered sternwheeler in 1926, in Dubuque, Iowa. Originally named the John W. Weeks, the craft was one of three identical towboats built - at a cost of $175,000 each - for the newly formed Upper Mississippi Barge Line. The 130-foot-long, 35-foot-wide steamboats were commissioned in an effort to jump-start commercial barge traffic on the Upper Mississippi River, which had slowed to a trickle since World War I. The boats, in their first 10 years of operation, were instrumental in quadrupling the tonnage of freight shipped on the Upper Mississippi. </DESCRIPTION>
